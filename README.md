# Week 1 Assignment

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
This file is refracting an exiting html and CSS style sheet made by Xandromus
I have implemented this site to be more accessible and cohesive
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
Homework assignment
- What problem does it solve?
Create a more accessible website and learn how to refract a project
- What did you learn?
Refracting a website



## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
I initially oppened the website and read through the acceptence criteria. I found that some parts of it were already done and some parts were in my opinion lacking
For example, I found that the elements in the webpage did not follow a logical order so I moved some of the boxes to apear 
more logical. I also found that some parts of the HTML were missing such as the alt option for image importation. I also tried implementing a @media command 
to make the webpage work with phones but I found that there were many issues with the ordeing and positioning.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:


![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

GitHub Profile = Mamad2000

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
